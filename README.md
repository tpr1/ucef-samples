# UCEF Samples

A collection of sample federations meant to illustrate different capabilities of the Universal Cyber-Physical Systems Environment for Federation (UCEF).

This repository is meant to be used in conjunction with the UCEF virtual machine available at https://github.com/usnistgov/ucef and cannot be compiled on its own.

## Note: 9/14/2018 mjb
The projects in this github project are being revised to work with the release of UCEF 1.0.0 BETA. A hot fix to the project will be deployed in the immediate future. Once the hot fix is produced, you can refresh this code with:

```
git checkout master
git pull
```

Each of the samples should build with a corresponding build.sh script and run.sh script.

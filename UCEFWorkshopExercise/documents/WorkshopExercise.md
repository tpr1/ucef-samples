# Workshop exercise
## Use Case
Use Case – participants make house federates that collaborate with common weather and utility federates. Houses perform thermostat algorithm and use dynamics based on constants from NET0 house (provided by Farhad and David). Utility has two sources of power – bulk and solar each at different price. Based on solar availability and the demand from the houses, the LMP is computed and distributed to the houses.
Interactions between house/weather/utility federates based on TE Challenge Component Model
Code for model house is provided already written to copy and paste into the UCEF generated code. Participants can choose values for temperature setpoint and perhaps other parameters for the house.
Federates will communicate over a private WiFi network set up in the workshop room
Need to determine what kind of display is possible for the experiment in progress – possibly log statements … fiware
Run a 24 hour experiment with hourly logical time steps – could consider 15 minute for more steps

## Install UCEF

1. Install Virtual Box version for your OS
1. Copy UCEF 1.0.0-alpha virtual machine to your computer
1. Run Virtual Box 
1. Choose File/Import Appliance and navigate to the UCEF image
1. Accept all defaults and import UCEF
1. Start up UCEF appliance from the Virtual Box menu

## Design a federate and interaction

## Build java code

## Run experiment
